## resize images
initially intended to do pre-processing to the imput image as to quickly adjust the image composition and fill the canvas with some pixel data,
this quickly escalated into a creative tool and small image processor yielding creative results.
Interesting patterns and compositions can be obtained to further pre optimize the diffusion generation process and ie. avoid cropped end results by providing enough pixel realestate.
Fill backgrounds with a p√Æcker or automated colour samplers: 'auto_edge' for the most occuring colour around the image edges, 'auto' for most occuring colour in the whole image.
Save your settings as a custom preset and use the sequencer to combine them one after another as a macro script. You can also save these runs as a new preset.
Use 'debug' to see the more complicated algoritms in steps.

TODO: implement this to run with feedback looping when generating.

current algoritms are:

### Dont resize
Dont do anything to the image, currently used for switching image modes (crop/mask) and usefull to quickly store sequence presets.

### Stretch
Strech all four sides of the image to fit the output size resulting in a disproportionate stretch.

### Resize and fill bg
Fill the background with a flat colour.

### Repeat edges
Resize the content bounds and fill the empty canvas with the stretched pixels of the border, typically the last pixel rows. 
When using more then a single pixel row, interesting patterns can be created.
There is also a option to mask this repeaded pattern with a flat background colour to get some more composition options.

### Scatter Fill
This one scatters random pixels like spores over a empty canvas based on the border of the imput. Then it further cultivates and blends these pixels locally to yield a more complex, artistic, organic fill.
When using a border thickness a border is added before the process and compress the effect within the image. 
The final pixel scatter is then layered behind the input image yielding the effect of an uncrop / extension.

### Fill Content Proportionally
scale the image as to proportionally fill the content to the output size. No part of the image is lost, empty canvas may be added.

### Fill Frame Proportionally
Scale the image as to fully fill the output frame while keeping the content proportionally. Some part of the image is usually cropped.

### Crop Content
Crop the image to its content bounding box (square). Transparancy, 100 percent black and white borders are also croppped.

### Zoom
crop inward or outward resulting in a zoom effect when going inward or outward. 
Use with a fill methed to creatively zoom outward (ie. scatter fill).
